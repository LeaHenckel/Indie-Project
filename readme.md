#SPACED OUT - Indie Project


Description:

Welcome to my project. I have chosen to code a website for a fictional company, SPACED OUT, which rents out tiny houses.

The website is coded using HTML, CSS and Javascript. BEM naming conventions have been used throughout.

On the website you will find 5 pages; front page, houses, about us, reservations and a 'thank you' page. By using the navigation links (or burger menu depending on which device you use) you can click around these pages.
There is a contact form on the "reservations" page, and on the "houses" page you will find a photo gallery.


The challenge was to develop a website that is not only aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly, but which can also engage visitors and convey my chosen indie concept in a convincing way. My work should also demonstrate that I have a basic understanding of the principles and disciplines I have been taught during the basic course.

 I hope you enjoy!
